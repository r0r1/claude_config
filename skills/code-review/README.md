# Code Review Skill for Claude Code

A global Claude Skill that performs comprehensive code reviews for GitHub/GitLab pull/merge requests with Linear/Jira integration. Works from any directory and auto-clones repositories when needed.

## Installation

The skill is already installed at: `~/.claude/skills/code-review/`

Files:
- `SKILL.md` - Main skill definition (required)
- `examples.md` - Usage examples
- `reference.md` - Technical documentation
- `README.md` - This file

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

Simply ask Claude to review a PR/MR:

```
Review GitHub PR https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123 with Linear ENG-456
```

Claude will:
1. Auto-detect the platform (GitHub/GitLab)
2. Clone the repo to `~/code/code-reviews/repo` (if needed)
3. Fetch the PR/MR branch
4. Get issue details from Linear/Jira
5. Review code against main branch
6. Post inline comments with findings

### Supported Patterns

**GitHub:**
```
Review PR https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
Review PR #123 for owner/repo
Review GitHub PR #123 with Linear ENG-456
```

**GitLab:**
```
Review MR https://gitlab.com/group/project/-/merge_requests/789
Review MR !789 for group/project
Review GitLab MR !789 with Jira PROJ-123
```

## Prerequisites

### Required MCP Servers

At least ONE version control MCP server:
- **GitHub MCP** - For GitHub repositories
- **GitLab MCP** - For GitLab repositories

### Optional MCP Servers

For issue tracking integration:
- **Linear MCP** - For Linear issues
- **Jira MCP** - For Jira issues

### Check MCP Servers

```bash
# List connected servers
/mcp list

# Inspect specific server
/mcp inspect github
/mcp inspect gitlab
/mcp inspect linear
/mcp inspect jira
```

## How It Works

### 1. Global Operation

Works from ANY directory:
- You don't need to navigate to the project
- Automatically clones to `~/code/code-reviews/{repo-name}`
- Returns you to original directory when done

### 2. Auto-Clone or Update

**If repo exists:**
- Navigates to `~/code/code-reviews/repo`
- Runs `git fetch origin`
- Checks out PR/MR branch

**If repo doesn't exist:**
- Clones to `~/code/code-reviews/repo`
- Checks out PR/MR branch

### 3. Compare Against Main Branch

Always compares against the main/master branch:
```bash
git diff main...HEAD
```

This shows exactly what changes are in the PR/MR.

### 4. Code Review Process

1. Fetches PR/MR details via MCP
2. Fetches issue details (Linear/Jira) via MCP
3. Gets existing review comments
4. Launches appropriate review agent:
   - `fullstack-code-reviewer` for Rails/Next.js
   - `mobile-code-reviewer` for Flutter
5. Reviews code for:
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Performance issues
   - Best practices
   - Test coverage
   - Issue alignment

### 5. Post Review Comments

**Priority:** Inline comments first, general comments as fallback

**Inline Comment (Preferred):**
- Posted directly on the code line
- Easy to navigate in GitHub/GitLab UI

**General Comment (Fallback):**
- Posted as PR/MR comment
- Includes file path and line number

### 6. Resolve Fixed Issues

Checks existing review comments:
- If issue is fixed, resolves the comment
- If still present, leaves it open
- Provides evidence for verification

## Configuration

### Repository Directory

Default: `~/code/code-reviews/`

All code review repositories are cloned here, separate from your regular development projects.

To change:
```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_REPO_DIR="$HOME/projects/reviews"
```

### Base Branch

Default: Auto-detect `main` or `master`

To override:
```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_BASE_BRANCH="develop"
```

## Examples

### Example 1: First-time Review

**Scenario:** You've never cloned the repo before

```
You: Review PR https://github.com/acme/backend/pull/456 with Linear ENG-789

Claude:
- Repository not found locally
- Cloning to ~/code/code-reviews/backend...
- Fetching PR branch...
- Fetching Linear issue ENG-789...
- Launching code review...
- Found 5 issues (2 critical, 3 warnings)
- Post comments? [1] Yes [2] No
```

### Example 2: Update Existing Repo

**Scenario:** Repo already exists at `~/code/code-reviews/backend`

```
You: Review PR #789 for acme/backend

Claude:
- Repository exists at ~/code/code-reviews/backend
- Fetching latest changes...
- Checking out PR branch...
- Launching code review...
- Found 2 issues (1 warning, 1 info)
```

### Example 3: Review Only Mode

**Scenario:** You want to see findings first

```
You: Review MR !123 for group/project but don't post comments

Claude:
- [Normal review process]
- Found 8 issues
- [Shows detailed findings]
- What would you like to do?
  [1] Resolve fixed and post new
  [2] Only resolve fixed
  [3] Only post new
  [4] Do nothing

You: 4

Claude: Review complete. No comments posted.
```

### Example 4: Multiple Projects

**Scenario:** Reviewing different projects in one session

```
# Review project A
Review PR #100 for company/api with LINEAR-1

# Review project B
Review PR #200 for company/web with LINEAR-2

# Both repos now in ~/code/code-reviews/
# Can switch between them easily
```

## User Interaction

## Review Comment Format

### Critical Issue

```markdown
🔴 Security: SQL Injection Risk

SQL query is vulnerable to injection attacks.

**Current Code:**
```ruby
User.where("email = '#{params[:email]}'")
```

**Suggested Fix:**
```ruby
User.where(email: params[:email])
```

**Recommendation:** Always use parameterized queries.

### Warning

```markdown
🟡 Performance: N+1 Query Detected

This will cause N+1 queries for large datasets.

**Current Code:**
```ruby
@posts.each do |post|
  post.author.name
end
```

**Suggested Fix:**
```ruby
@posts.includes(:author).each do |post|
  post.author.name
end
```

### Info/Suggestion

```markdown
🟢 Best Practice: Extract to Helper Method

This logic could be extracted for better reusability.

**Suggested Fix:**
```ruby
# In helper
def format_currency(amount)
  "$#{amount.round(2)}"
end
```

## Troubleshooting

### Skill Not Activated

**Problem:** Claude doesn't recognize review request

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check skill exists
ls ~/.claude/skills/code-review/SKILL.md

# Verify frontmatter format
head -5 ~/.claude/skills/code-review/SKILL.md
```

### MCP Server Not Found

**Problem:** `GitHub MCP server not connected`

**Solution:**
1. Run `/mcp list` to check servers
2. Configure MCP server in settings
3. Verify API token/credentials
4. Restart Claude Code

### Clone Fails

**Problem:** `Failed to clone repository`

**Solution:**
- Check repository URL is correct
- Verify git credentials configured
- Check network connection
- Ensure you have access to the repo

### No Comments Posted

**Problem:** Review completes but no comments appear

**Solution:**
- Check MCP server permissions
- Verify API token scopes
- Look for error messages in output
- Try "review only" mode first

### Large PR Timeout

**Problem:** Review takes too long or fails

**Solution:**
- Break PR into smaller chunks
- Review specific files only
- Increase timeout if possible
- Review locally with git diff

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Review Focus

```
Review PR #123 but only check security issues
Review MR !456 focusing on performance
```

### Specific File Patterns

```
Review PR #789 for files in app/controllers/
Review MR !123 for *.rb files only
```

### Skip Issue Integration

```
Review PR https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
(without Linear/Jira reference)
```

## Tips & Best Practices

1. **Small PRs** - Better reviews for PRs under 500 lines
2. **Provide context** - Always include issue ID when possible
3. **Review early** - Catch issues before they compound
4. **Use "review only"** - Preview findings first
5. **Keep repos organized** - Use standard `~/code/code-reviews/` location
6. **Resolve fixed** - Keep PR discussions clean
7. **Manual verification** - Don't rely 100% on automation for critical issues

## Limitations

1. **Token limits** - Very large PRs (>2000 lines) may hit limits
2. **Binary files** - Cannot review images, videos, PDFs
3. **Merge conflicts** - Won't resolve conflicts
4. **Rate limits** - API limits may slow operations
5. **Authentication** - Requires proper MCP setup
